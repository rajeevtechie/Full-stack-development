    <h1>Rajeev Kumar Gupta</h1>
    <p>Hi there! I’m Rajeev Kumar Gupta, a passionate web development 
        enthusiast with a growing expertise in HTML and a keen eye for 
        user-focused design. My journey began with crafting clean, semantic structures 
        and has expanded into exploring multimedia integration, interactive forms, and 
        responsive layouts.
💡      I’m fueled by curiosity and precision—whether I’m debugging table 
         attributes like rowspan and colspan.
